### Hi there 👋

I am a highly motivated, and driven Embedded System Engineer focusing on IoT and Wireless systems as both hardware and software design.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on one device that stays on the container for the entire lifecycle delivering real-time tracking, door security, intermodal mode identification, and carbon counter for each move the container makes.
- 👯 I’m contributing to ZephyrOS and Robot Operating System (ROS)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux kernel & driver development for Android Ecosystem
- 💬 Ask me about IoT systems, software & hardware design and cloud infrastructure. I'm also obsessed with robots
- ⚡ Fun fact: I loovveee pasta with yoghurt (don't get mad at me my Italian friends :) )
